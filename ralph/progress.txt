## Codebase Patterns
- Use .venv/bin/python and .venv/bin/pip for all Python operations (not system python)
- The project uses Python 3.14 with a local .venv virtual environment
- Existing deps: fastapi, uvicorn[standard], httpx, beautifulsoup4, trafilatura, lxml, pydantic>=2.5.0

## 2026-02-18 21:30 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added all required Python packages for SaaS backend to requirements.txt
- Files changed: requirements.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use .venv/bin/pip to install, not system pip
  - All packages installed successfully: passlib[bcrypt], python-jose[cryptography], asyncpg, sqlalchemy[asyncio], alembic, stripe, sib-api-v3-sdk, slowapi, python-multipart, email-validator
  - stripe installed at v14.3.0 (much newer than >=7.0.0 requirement - API may differ from older docs)
  - sib-api-v3-sdk installed at v7.6.0
---

## 2026-02-18 21:35 - US-002
- What was implemented: Created database.py with lazy-initialized async SQLAlchemy engine
- Files changed: database.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Engine creation must be deferred (lazy) since DATABASE_URL may be empty at import time
  - Use postgresql+asyncpg:// prefix for async engine; handle postgres:// and postgresql:// URL variants
  - async_session_factory is a callable that returns AsyncSession instances
  - get_db() is an async generator FastAPI dependency that handles commit/rollback/close
---

## 2026-02-18 21:40 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created migrations/001_initial.sql with all 5 tables and RLS policies
- Files changed: migrations/001_initial.sql (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used app.current_user_id session variable pattern for RLS (set via SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = ... before queries)
  - pgcrypto extension needed for gen_random_uuid()
  - ai_usage has UNIQUE constraint on user_id (one row per user for monthly tracking)
  - All tables use gen_random_uuid() for primary keys
---

## 2026-02-18 21:45 - US-004
- What was implemented: Created db_models.py with SQLAlchemy ORM models for all 5 tables
- Files changed: db_models.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use mapped_column with Mapped[] typed annotations (SQLAlchemy 2.0 style)
  - JSONB from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql for JSON columns
  - UUID from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql with as_uuid=True for proper Python UUID handling
  - ai_usage has unique constraint on user_id via __table_args__ = (UniqueConstraint(...),)
  - AiUsage relationship is uselist=False (one-to-one with User)
---

## 2026-02-18 21:50 - US-005
- What was implemented: Created auth/utils.py with password hashing and JWT token functions
- Files changed: auth/__init__.py (new), auth/utils.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - passlib[bcrypt] has compatibility issues with bcrypt 5.x (missing __about__ attribute, changed API)
  - Use `import bcrypt` directly instead of passlib for hashing: bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12) and bcrypt.hashpw()
  - JWT_SECRET is read at module level but uses os.environ.get() - set before importing if testing
  - decode_token raises HTTPException 401 on any JWTError (expired, invalid signature, etc.)
---

## 2026-02-18 21:55 - US-006, US-007, US-008
- What was implemented: auth/router.py with all auth endpoints + auth/dependencies.py
- Files changed: auth/router.py (new), auth/dependencies.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GET /user/me uses lambda dependency placeholder in auth/router.py; overridden in main.py with app.dependency_overrides
  - httpOnly refresh cookie uses path="/auth/refresh" to scope it to only that endpoint
  - forgot-password stores SHA-256 hash of reset token (not plaintext) in DB
  - send_password_reset_email imported as `from email_service import ...` (not `email.service` - avoid stdlib email module collision)
  - Rate limiting for /auth/login applied in main.py (not in the router)
---

## 2026-02-18 22:00 - US-009
- What was implemented: email_service.py with Brevo transactional email functions
- Files changed: email_service.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Created email_service.py (not email/service.py) to avoid collision with Python stdlib `email` module
  - auth/router.py already imports from email_service correctly
  - sib_api_v3_sdk uses Configuration() with api_key["api-key"] pattern
  - All email functions are synchronous (sib_api_v3_sdk is not async)
---

## 2026-02-18 22:05 - US-010, US-011, US-012
- What was implemented: billing/router.py (checkout, portal, webhook), billing/dependencies.py
- Files changed: billing/__init__.py, billing/router.py, billing/dependencies.py (all new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - stripe 14.x uses stripe.checkout.Session.create(), stripe.billing_portal.Session.create()
  - stripe 14.x: stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError for invalid webhooks
  - stripe.Webhook.construct_event() validates signature
  - User is found by metadata user_id in checkout.session.completed (more reliable than email)
  - check_bulk_url_limit is a sync function (not async), not a FastAPI dependency
---

## 2026-02-18 22:10 - US-013, US-014, US-015
- What was implemented: sessions/router.py, links/router.py, ai_router/router.py
- Files changed: sessions/, links/, ai_router/ directories (all new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used ai_router/ directory (not ai/) to avoid conflicts with built-in Python names
  - google-generativeai is deprecated; use google-genai with `from google import genai`
  - genai.Client(api_key=...).models.generate_content() is the modern API
  - AI usage resets monthly based on period_end check
  - Bulk delete uses SQLAlchemy delete() with .in_() for efficient batch operations
---

## 2026-02-18 22:15 - US-016
- What was implemented: Updated main.py with all new routers, SlowAPI middleware, CORS from env var
- Files changed: main.py, auth/router.py (fixed /user/me dependency)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import get_current_user directly in auth/router.py - no circular import
  - slowapi: app.state.limiter = limiter; app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, ...)
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var: comma-separated list of origins
  - billing/webhook is included normally since Stripe signature verification is in the endpoint itself
  - Rate limit for /auth/login goes in the route decorator: @limiter.limit("10/15minutes")
  - The _noop middleware was unnecessary, removed it
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-017
- What was implemented: React Router setup, AuthProvider, all page components (Login, Register, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, Pricing, Account, AppPage)
- Files changed: frontend/src/main.tsx (updated), frontend/src/router.tsx (new), frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (new), frontend/src/pages/*.tsx (all new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - router.tsx and AuthContext.tsx were already partially created prior to this iteration
  - main.tsx now wraps with AuthProvider + AppRouter (BrowserRouter was already present)
  - AppPage.tsx simply re-exports the existing App component: `export { default } from '../App'`
  - All pages use inline CSS styles with CSS variables from index.css (var(--chrome-bg), var(--brand-gradient), etc.)
  - The original App.tsx contains the full application logic - it becomes the "main app page" via AppPage.tsx
  - Build uses `npm run build` (tsc -b && vite build) in frontend/ directory
  - react-router-dom v7 is installed (already in package.json before this story)
  - ProtectedRoute checks isLoading state and shows spinner before redirecting to avoid flash on session restore
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-018
- What was implemented: AuthContext was already fully implemented in US-017. Verified all acceptance criteria are met and build passes.
- Files changed: ralph/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-018 (AuthContext) was implemented alongside US-017 in a single prior iteration - the PRD story was already complete
  - AuthContext.tsx provides: user, accessToken, isLoading, login, logout, register, setAccessToken
  - Access token is stored in React state only (not localStorage) - security-compliant
  - Session restoration uses POST /auth/refresh with credentials: 'include' to send the httpOnly cookie
  - fetchMe() is memoized with useCallback to avoid re-rendering loops in useEffect
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-025
- What was implemented: Added in-app upgrade prompts for Free users hitting plan limits in App.tsx and ContextualEditor.tsx
- Files changed: frontend/src/App.tsx, frontend/src/components/detail/ContextualEditor.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - isFree check: `const isFree = !user || user.plan === 'free'` (covers logged-out users too)
  - URL limit banner shown inline in 'select' step when isFree && selectedUrls.size > 10
  - Save Session button replaced with lock Link to /pricing for free users
  - Sessions header button shows lock icon for free users, links to /pricing
  - AI suggestions gate: handleGetSuggestions shows Pro modal instead of calling API for free users
  - Auto-fetch on mount also gated: only runs if !isFree
  - Pro upgrade modal is a fixed overlay with dismiss button
  - Used Link from react-router-dom for internal navigation (not window.location.href)
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-024
- What was implemented: Enhanced Account.tsx with creation date, AI usage progress bar, and Manage Billing button. Updated AuthContext User interface to include created_at field.
- Files changed: frontend/src/pages/Account.tsx, frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AuthContext User interface needed created_at added to include account creation date
  - AI usage fetched from /user/me/usage endpoint (gracefully handles if endpoint doesn't exist yet)
  - Manage Billing button calls getBillingPortal() from api.ts, falls back to /pricing on error
  - AI usage progress bar turns red when >= 180/200 calls used (warning threshold)
  - Progress bar uses Math.min() to cap at 100% width
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-023
- What was implemented: Pricing page was already fully implemented in a prior iteration (US-017). Verified all acceptance criteria are met and build passes.
- Files changed: ralph/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pricing.tsx has monthly/annual toggle, Free vs Pro two-column layout
  - Uses window.location.href = data.url to redirect to Stripe checkout/portal
  - Detects Pro status via user?.plan === 'pro' from AuthContext
  - Uses API_BASE directly (not api.ts functions) for billing calls - could be refactored to use createCheckoutSession/getBillingPortal from api.ts in future
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-022
- What was implemented: Updated frontend/src/services/api.ts with auth headers, token refresh interceptor, and new SaaS API functions
- Files changed: frontend/src/services/api.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - registerAuthCallbacks() pattern: api.ts registers _onRefresh and _onClearAuth callbacks from AuthContext at startup
  - Token refresh: if 401 received, call _onRefresh(), if it returns a new token retry the request once
  - createAuthenticatedFetch(token) returns a typed helper function for component-level use
  - All existing functions (getConfig, getSitemap, analyzePage, bulkAnalyze, fetchTargetPage) now accept optional token param
  - New functions: getMe, getSessions, createSession, deleteSession, getSavedLinks, createSavedLink, deleteSavedLink, getAiSuggestion, createCheckoutSession, getBillingPortal
  - fetchJson always sends credentials: 'include' for httpOnly cookie support
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-021
- What was implemented: ForgotPassword and ResetPassword pages were already implemented in a prior iteration (US-017). Verified all acceptance criteria are met and build passes.
- Files changed: ralph/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ForgotPassword.tsx: always shows success message regardless of API response (prevents email enumeration)
  - ResetPassword.tsx: reads token from URL query param using useSearchParams hook
  - ResetPassword redirects to /login?reset=success on success (not just /login)
  - ResetPassword shows invalid link message if no token in URL params
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-020
- What was implemented: Register page was already fully implemented in a prior iteration (US-017). Verified all acceptance criteria are met and build passes.
- Files changed: ralph/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-020 (Register page) was implemented alongside US-017 in a single prior iteration
  - Register.tsx has: email/password/confirmPassword fields, real-time password strength indicator (4 checks), inline mismatch error, redirect to / on success, link to /login
  - getPasswordStrength() helper checks: length>=10, hasLetter, hasNumber, hasSpecial
  - Button disabled when passwordMismatch is true (prevents submission with mismatched passwords)
---

## 2026-02-18 - US-019
- What was implemented: Login page was already fully implemented in a prior iteration (US-017). Verified all acceptance criteria are met and build passes.
- Files changed: ralph/prd.json (marked passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-019 (Login page) was implemented alongside US-017 in a single prior iteration
  - Login.tsx has: email/password/rememberMe fields, inline error display, redirect to / on success, links to /forgot-password and /register
  - Uses dark theme with CSS variables (var(--chrome-bg), var(--brand-gradient), etc.)
  - All pages use inline CSS styles with CSSProperties type for TypeScript safety
